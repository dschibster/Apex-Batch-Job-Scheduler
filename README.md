# SFDX Batch Orchestrator

This is a fork from the original <a href="https://github.com/ianhuang/Apex-Batch-Job-Scheduler">Apex Batch Job Scheduler</a> from Salesforce Labs, including several improvements.

# Features

-   Configuration of Batch Job Schedules from within a Salesforce App
-   Options to configure Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly schedules, with automatic generation of Cron Expressions
-   If the options presented don't fit, you can also write your own Cron Expression!
-   If you already have a Batch Job running, you can even incorporate it without much hassle!
-   Grouping of Batch Jobs to handle dependencies
-   Flexible switching of Batch Sizes in case of scaling problems
-   Logging of Batch Job results to see if they were successful
-   Options to directly run any Batch Job or Schedule that is currently scheduled from the UI
-   **Enhanced Logging!** Now allows you to log information and successes/failures in a Batch Job. More information available in the Documentation.
